<p><a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/" title="Jmeter">Jmeter </a>  is a great load testing tool. Creating a parameter file is not very clearly described in the documentation.
</p><p>
When creating a test plan, just after the creation of the thread group you can insert a CSV configuration element. This allows you to specify a CSV file that you can reuse in you http parameters:
<ul>
	<li>CSV configuration element:</li>
<ul>
	<li>filename (only filenames seem to work, not full paths. It's looking for the file in the same directory as the testscenario file.</li>
	<li>the fieldnames f.i. USERNAME,PASSWORD</li>
</ul>
	<li>In your test element you can refer to them as {USERNAME} and {PASSWORD}</li>
</ul>

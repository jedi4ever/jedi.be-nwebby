<p>More info can be found @

</a>
</p><p>Each request is logged two times. The first time is <em>before</em> it's
processed further (that is, after receiving the headers). The second log
entry is written <em>after</em> the request processing at the same time
where normal logging occurs.
</p><p>
In order to identify each request, a unique request ID is assigned.
This forensic ID can be cross logged in the normal transfer log using the
<code>%{forensic-id}n</code> format string. If you're using
<code class="module"><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</a></code>, its generated ID will be used.
</p><p>
The first line logs the forensic ID, the request line and all received
headers, separated by pipe characters (<code>|</code>). A sample line
looks like the following (all on one line):
<div class="example"><code>
+yQtJf8CoAB4AAFNXBIEAAAAA|GET /manual/de/images/down.gif
HTTP/1.1|Host:localhost%3a8080|User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11;
U; Linux i686; en-US; rv%3a1.6) Gecko/20040216
Firefox/0.8|Accept:image/png, <var>etc...</var>
</code></div>
</p><p>The plus character at the beginning indicates that this is the first log
line of this request. The second line just contains a minus character and
the ID again:
<div class="example"><code>
-yQtJf8CoAB4AAFNXBIEAAAAA
</code></div>
</p><p>The <code>check_forensic</code> script takes as its argument the name
of the logfile. It looks for those <code>+</code>/<code>-</code> ID pairs
and complains if a request was not completed.

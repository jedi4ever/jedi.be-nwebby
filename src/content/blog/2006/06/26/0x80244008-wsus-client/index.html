While debugging a WSUS client I took a look in c:\Windows\Windows Update.log<br />In the console it kept saying error: 0x80244008<br /><br /><br />It seems that my disk was filled during the night, and after clearing the storage of the WSUS, I still had to restart the IIS server. After that it was ok.<br /><br />

<div align="center"><img title="Opening Circle" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3071/2554830258_13e3664d22.jpg" border="0" height="84" alt="Opening Circle" width="500" /><br /></div>For the first time I've attended an <a href="http://www.openspaceworld.org/">Open Space</a> at the <a href="http://www.agileopen.net/en/agile-open-europe-2008">Agile Open 2008 Conference</a>. I must say , I really love the format. Two days of energizing talks with people with a lot of different backgrounds. Hopefully later I get to organize one myself.<br /><br />Therefore I want to thank Willem van den Ende and Marc Evers (<a href="http://www.piecemealgrowth.nl">PiecemealGrowth)</a><br />The drinks and diner were all sponsored. Of course being of Belgium I especially liked the Belgian Beers offered by Koen of <a href="http://www.inxin.be">Inxin</a> . Cheers! He also made me realise that IT/Infrastructure eventually have to evolve into a more participating role instead of waiting on the receiving side.<br /><br />Have a look at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sonicwalker/sets/72157605451505742/show/">Harald's pictures</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84889127@N00/sets/72157605629707647/with/2580481117/">Willem's pictures</a><br /><br /> <a href="http://www.inxin.com/" title="InxIn" target="_blank"><br /></a>

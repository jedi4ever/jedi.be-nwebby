On our current project here at <a href="http://www.vrtmedialab.be/">VRT Medialab</a> we're implementing a multimedia search engine. One thing we always discuss is what the end-user is looking for. Is he looking for one specific result or a broad range of result? Does he know what he is looking for, or is he merely figuring out what the problem domain is about. After some research I came across the article <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/four_modes_of_seeking_information_and_how_to_design_for_them">Four Modes of Seeeking and how to design for them</a> . Have a look at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/morville/collections/72157603785835882/">Search Patterns Collections by Peter Morville</a>. That will get you started on designing some GUI. Users are creative, you never know if a user want to <a href="http://www.midomi.com/">sing</a> ,  <a href="http://labs.systemone.at/retrievr/">sketch</a> or <a href="http://www.songtapper.com/">tap with his fingers.</a> Google is also experimenting with it with <a href="http://www.google.com/experimental/">alternative views</a> such as timeline. Combine this with tagclouds like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a> and <a href="http://www.quintura.com/">Quintura</a>. Others like <a href="http://www.dipity.com/mashups/timetube">timetube</a> apply the same techniques to youtube videos. <a href="http://www.kartoo.com/">Kartoo</a> and <a href="http://www.liveplasma.com/">LivePlasma</a> experiment with graph structures.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The bottom line is, prepare what ever you can to save on computer cycles you want, you'll never anticipate every way a users want to search or have it's results complete. That's why we have to present the enduser with the possibility to easily switch between searching techniques and results presentations. <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0316114758/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J205NJWWL._SL500_BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_.jpg" border="0" id="prodImage" height="240" alt="A Perfect Mess: The Hidden Benefits of Disorder - How Crammed Closets, Cluttered Offices, and on-the-Fly Planning Make the World a Better Place" width="240" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.aperfectmess.com/">http://www.aperfectmess.com/<br /></a>

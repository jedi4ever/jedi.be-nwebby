I've been following a training at <a href="http://www.nlp.be/">www.nlp.be</a> for over a year now. Whenever I talk to people on this training, I have difficulty explaining what it really about. To me it is all about people: this is the main reason why me as an IT'er wanted to follow this course. It gives you a lot of models to work with human behaviour. Not that there is a one size, fits all; but it does provide you insight.<br />I really enjoyed working with Chrisse Mahieu, it is clear she's a credible and really professional person. I would recommend the institute and the training to everyone.<br /><br />

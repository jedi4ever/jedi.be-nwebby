I'll be talking  on my experiences on <a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/424">Agile Infrastructure and Operations</a>.

Much of these techniques can be applied to Sales (agile-selling), User-Interface (agile-ui), Infrastructure (agile-infrastructure).<br />During my talk I hope to energize people to go beyond their 'development' circle. And show examples where I have seen in possible. (<a href="http://www.jedi.be/presentations/IEEE-Agile-Infrastructure.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Paper</a>)<br />

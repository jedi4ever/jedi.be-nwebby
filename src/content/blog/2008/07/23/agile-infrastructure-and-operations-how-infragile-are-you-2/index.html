I'll be talking  on my experiences on <a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/424">Agile Infrastructure and Operations</a>. It often strikes me that the Agile community is only known in development circles, whereas the Agile idea also applies to other sections of the company. Much of these techniques can be applied to Sales (agile-selling), User-Interface (agile-ui), Infrastructure (agile-infrastructure).<br />During my talk I hope to energize people to go beyond their 'development' circle. And show examples where I have seen in possible. (<a href="https://www.jedi.be/presentations/IEEE-Agile-Infrastructure.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Paper</a>)<br />

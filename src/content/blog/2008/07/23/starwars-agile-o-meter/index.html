Agile has been around now for a couple of years. It's slowly spreading within companies. To gather info on how it spreads beyond the development circles, we've put up a <a href="https://www.jedi.be/pages/starwars-agile-o-meter/">Starwars Agile-O-Meter</a>. The results will be used in my session on <a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/424">Agile Infrastructure and operations</a> at <a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/node/424">Agile 2008 conference</a> in Toronto.
Thanks for participating in the survey!

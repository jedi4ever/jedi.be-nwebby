While researching my past digital life, I came across my first steps on the Internet. As a matter of fact the Internet too was making it's first steps. During my thesis at the <a href="http://biomath.ugent.be/">Biomath University of Ghent</a>, I ran a website called "URL Heaven": it collected the sites I found and I put them into categories in a way similar to yahoo today. <br /><br />I announced on the <a href="http://groups.google.be/group/comp.infosystems.www.providers/browse_thread/thread/ba190e425e813471/ed6d4cc7133d9dfc?hl=nl&lnk=st&amp;q=URL+heaven+pdebois#ed6d4cc7133d9dfc">mailing list</a>.<br /><br />After awhile, find categories was a bit difficult so <a href="http://groups.google.be/group/bit.listserv.autocat/browse_thread/thread/3d99103da08504b9/38d9e53e705ca942?hl=nl&lnk=st&amp;q=URL+heaven+pdebois#38d9e53e705ca942">I called out for help</a>:<br /><br />Some leftovers on the web can be found with this google search : <a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&q=%22URL+heaven%22+pdebois&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=">http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=%22URL+heaven%22+pdebois&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=</a><br /><br />It seems that I was quoted in a research paper by Hans Martin Adorf called the "<a href="http://www.jedi.be/pages/url-heaven/resource+discovery+on+the+internet.pdf">Resource Discovery on the Internet [PDF]</a>", back in 1994. That means 2008-1994= 14 years ago!<br /><br />The site was closed down after I found myself a <a href="http://www.axio.be">real job</a>. Boy, if only I had known....<br />

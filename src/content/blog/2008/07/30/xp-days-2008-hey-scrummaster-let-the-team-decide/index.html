A self-organizing team is a powerful concept. But what if the team<br />collectively decides to go into a direction that you as a Scrum Master<br />know for sure that they will hit problems. (or at least you think)<br /><br />F.i.<br />they decide to abandon retrospectives. Will you respect their decision<br />or will you try to change it? Would you go for option 1) respect the<br />team or 2) try to convince the team away from their decision.<br /><br />May<br />I ask you, intelligent agilist, to provide examples of similar<br />conflicts you encountered in real life. If you solved the situation,<br />please let us know how. If not, just post the conflict.<br /><br />Feel free to give input if you prefer related interesting topics like<br /> /&gt;when is a team truly self directing<br /> /&gt;how do you create a self directing team<br /> /&gt;what competences does a team need to have in order to be self directing<br /> /&gt;what if they go in the wrong direction (according to whom?)<br /> /&gt;the role of project leaders and managers wrt self organizing team<br /> /&gt;products owners having trouble not telling teams HOW to do the work<br /><br />If our session gets selected, we will present your feedback at the <a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008/">XP Days Benelux 2008</a>.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.implementingscrum.com/images/061023-scrumtoon.jpg" /><br /><br />We (Lieven Baeyens, Peter Janssens, Patrick Debois) have opened up a blog.

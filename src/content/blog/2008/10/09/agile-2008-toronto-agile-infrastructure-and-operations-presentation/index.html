I realized I never put my presentation online. Here it is: <a href="https://www.jedi.be/presentations/agile-infrastructure-agile-2008.pdf">Agile 2008: Infrastructure and Operations</a><br /><br />I really enjoyed presenting it. The questions came sometimes really unexpected, it reminded me I still need to more study work. Some of the major players have been 'toying' with the idea but then on a different scale ... <br /><br />Another thing I realized is, that seeing is believing. Next time I have to include a demo of what I mean instead of just slides. During the conference I met the guys of Puppet who proposed an open space session about it. To bad nobody (aside me) was interested then ;-)<br /><br />So next year Chicago we will see ...<br /><br />

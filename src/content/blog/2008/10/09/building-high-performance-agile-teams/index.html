We did an exercise to learn how to come to a consensus with a group. The goal was to find the way to best spend a (real!) Five Dollar bill. As I was the only one to be from Europe around the table, I proposed to take it home and show it to my kids. Apparently everybody fell for the idea so we moved on to discussing how I was to present it. Another questioned I had was: you have three kids, how will you avoid them fighting over it?.

The oldest one asked: 'Daddy, is this Abraham Lincoln?'<br /><br />Thanks Melissa, Brent, Gil, and the others.<br /><br />The slides of the presentation are available at <a href="http://submissions.agile2008.org/files/CD-5099_0.pdf">http://<cite>submissions.<b>agile</b>2008.org/files/CD-5099_0.pdf</cite></a><br />I recorded the audio of the session, listen here: <a href="https://www.jedi.be/pages/agile-2008/session-building-high-performance-teams.mp3">https://www.jedi.be/pages/agile-2008/session-building-high-performance-teams.mp3</a><br /><br />Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/agile2008Toronto" class="performancingtags" rel="tag">agile2008Toronto</a>

I was pleasantly suprised to see that it had a MacOSX version! Most of it worked. The only thing that got me bugging was that I could not <i>rename my activities</i>. It would just have a text field but did not allow me to type anything in it. <br /><br />I found the solution burried in :<br /><a href="http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/board/message?board.id=remote_software&message.id=3702">http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/board/message?board.id=remote_software&amp;message.id=3702<br /></a><br /><br /><b>You need to close your browser</b> when doing this. I guess the program actually used the Safari Webkit to work. And when another program uses the same Webkit, it will not focus correctly.<br /><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>

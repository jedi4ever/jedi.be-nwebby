This night, our disk was full and I had to restart the apache and mysql server. My blog greeted me with an Wordpress error message: It asked me to re-run the install.php thinking it was not yet installed.
<br>
I found that my database was corrupt and tried to make a dump to repair:
<br>
$ mysqldump mysite_blog -u myuser -p
<br>
And after a while it gave up with:
<pre>mysqldump: Can't get CREATE TABLE for table `wp_options` (Can't open file: 'wp_options.MYD'. (errno: 145))</pre>
I found the solution at <a href="http://support.discusware.com/center/resources/errors/mysql145.html">http://support.discusware.com/center/resources/errors/mysql145.html</a>
<pre>$ mysql -u myuser -p mysite_blogmysql> REPAIR TABLE wp_options;</pre>
That did the trick! We're back in business...

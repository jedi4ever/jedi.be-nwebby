<a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008">XP Days Benelux 2008</a>: aah, it was great! I had a hard time going to work again on monday. It seems that my brain was still in overdrive, and everything at work , was sooo slow. Kudos to the organizing commitee.

<a href="https://www.jedi.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/3054080128_ae8d9b268c.jpg"><img title="Emotion Meter" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-545" src="https://www.jedi.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/3054080128_ae8d9b268c-225x300.jpg" height="106" alt="" width="79" /></a>When arriving the ohmp's (one halve minute presentations of the sessions) where already busy. Still a nice way to see what sessions to pick. I skipped the first session so I could put up my <a href="https://www.jedi.be/blog/2008/11/19/visu-wall-experiment-at-xpdays-2008-benelux/">Visu-wall project</a>. I got some nice ideas from this: the spaghetti bridge Scrum Board game, the emotion-meter (thanks Tjakko) , and someone commenting that ScrumMaster should be a ScrumSlave ;-)
<br>
It was the second time I went and it felt different: because during the past two years I got to know so many people , I went to less sessions and talked to more people. This is a great networking place.
<br>
My first session was on <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-agile-project-management">Mingle</a> by <a href="http://www.redrobinsoftware.net/blog/" target="_blank">Koen De Hondt</a>. The product looks great, and it made me wonder what the ideal electronic scrumboard would/should look like. The nice thing was it was a non-vendor and hands-onview on the product, so there was a lot of experience at hand.

<td>Another session I went to, was the session <a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008/sessions/PairCoaching%20Agile%20Game.html">Paircoaching Agile Game</a> by <a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008/Yves%20Hanoulle.html">Yves Hanoulle</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008/Ignace%20Hanoulle.html">Ignace Hanoulle</a>. It was nice to see them for the first Live! It struck me that the session had a lot of layers, like an onion. Invisible at the surface, but a lot of details. An example of this was , that technical people like to keep on making things better, even if the customer agreed it was okay,  with the risk of breaking things again and leaving the customer with a broken system when he needs it.</td>

At the end of the second day, <a href="http://pjnowhow.blogspot.com" title="Peter Janssens" target="_blank">Peter Janssens</a> and <a href="https://www.jedi.be/blog/">me</a> (Patrick Debois), we did our session "Hey ScrumMaster let the team decide": this is about how f.i. a ScrumMaster can handle conflict situations with his self organizing teams; it's clear that there is a fine balance between this. We had some great discussions, and that's what we really wanted. Afterwards the<a href="http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2008/Retrospective.html"> feedback was fantastic</a>! This is also thanks to our try-out session hosted by the nice people of <a href="http://www.ilean.be" title="Ilean" target="_blank">Ilean</a>. You guys rock. A lot of people asked us to share the playmobil video's. The slides go here: <a href="https://www.jedi.be/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/hey-scrummaster-let-the-team-decide-xpdays-benelux-2008.pdf">Hey ScrumMaster: let the team decide Xpdays Benelux 2008</a>

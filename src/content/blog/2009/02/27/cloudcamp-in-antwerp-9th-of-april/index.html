If you are reading this blog, chances are that I talked you on a term called <em>Agile Infrastructure</em> or if I'm a good mood I tend to present myself as an <em>Infrastructure Developer</em>. Cloudcomputing is the field where this is actually put in practice Think of it like providing and using an API for doing some of the <a href="http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/saasweek/2007/10/attack_of_the_-aas_acronyms_or/">*AAS work</a>. A must for both developers and sysadmins because if you want it or not, both worlds ARE coming together.

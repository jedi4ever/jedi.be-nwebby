This article describes how you can setup a transparent proxy with squid for your vmware virtual machines using Advanced NAT techniques.
<br>
There are two options to have virtual machines use a Squid for proxying and caching downloads:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Proxy:</strong> configure all applications such as yum, yast using their proxy setting f.i. using http_proxy env variable</li>
	<li><strong>Transparant Proxy:</strong> use a transparent proxy server that automatically catches all traffic on port 80 and redirects it to a squid proxy</li>
</ol>
The first options is difficult to manage and you need to have a good knowledge of all proxy configurations of the applications. The second is as says 'transparent' and scales better.
<br>
The most traditional approach for implementing option 2 is by setting up a squid box somewhere in the network and have a system where all the traffic passes redirect traffic to that box. While this is certainly a recommended setup, it does requires an additional box to do the job. In this solution the squid will be running on the box hosting all the vmware machines.

<br>
But first things first, lets install squid (we used 2.5Stable 12). More info at <a href="http://www.wains.be/index.php/2006/12/18/transparent-squid/">http://www.wains.be/index.php/2006/12/18/transparent-squid/
</a>
<br>
# yum install squid
<br>
Edit the config  (/etc/squid/squid.conf) to make it act as caching proxy
<br>
<em>#caching large files for ISO and other stuff</em>
maximum_object_size 40960000 KB
<em>#enable access from hosts in vmnet1</em>
acl our_vmnet1_network src 192.168.1.0/24
http_access allow our_vmnet1
<em>#virtual port for squid</em>
httpd_accel_port 80
<em>#enable proxy accelarator</em>
httpd_accel_with_proxy on
<em>#enable correct headers for transparent proxy</em>
httpd_accel_uses_host_header on
<br>
And then start squid
<br>
#/etc/init.d/squid start
<br>
and logs go into /var/squid/access.log
<br>
So what are our options for the virtual machines networking?
<ol>
	<li><strong>Using a bridged network</strong>: bridging makes virtual machines appear on the same network as the server hosting the virtual machines, so vmnet0 will be on the same network as eth0</li>
	<li><strong>Using a NAT network</strong>: the nat interface of vmware actually is maintained by the vmnet-natd process. Traffic does not passes the network stack so that we can change it with iptables Redirect</li>
	<li><strong>Using a Host-Only network:</strong> this is normally not an option because traffic on a host-only network interface is supposed not to leave the box. Still we can make this to work with a bit of extra work.</li>
</ol>
The image shows for option the route the packets take. As option 1 &amp; 2 are not really an option for us, we will concentrate on option 3.
<br>
<em>Step 0: make vmnet1 available so that we can use it at the vmware server level</em>
<br>
# vmnet-netifup  -d /var/run/vmnet1.pid /dev/vmnet1 vmnet1
<br>
now vmnet1 shows up if we do an ifconfig vmnet1 and give it the IP
<br>
<em>Step 1: setting the correct gateway and DNS settings for vmnet1</em>
<br>
As vmnet1 normally does not have a gateway, the <em>/etc/vmware/vmnet1/dhcpd/dhcpd.conf</em> does not contain the following settings
<br>
option domain-name-servers IP-from-your-DNS;
option domain-name "your-domain.com";
option routers 192.168.1.10;
<br>
The 192.168.1.10 is the IP address you assigned using the manual ipconfig . It has nothing todo with the vmnet1 ip-address that you during the vmware-config.pl to your vmnet1 interface. See <em>/etc/vmware/config</em>, vmnet1.hostonlyaddress= "192.168.1.1" setting.
<br>
<em>Step 2: enable forwarding</em>
<br>
now that we have two interface we can play with, we can enable the forwarding
<br>
# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# iptables -A FORWARD -i vmnet1 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
<br>
<em>Step 3: redirect traffic on destination port 80 to 3128 (Squid)</em>
<br>
# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmnet1  -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128
<br>
<em>Step 4: masquerade traffic coming from virtual </em>
<br>
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE
<br>
<em>Step 5: if you're  using a firewall check that you enabled port 3128</em>
<br>
# iptables -L -t nat
<br>
# iptables -L
<br>
errors will go into /var/log/firewall
<br>
Now check that when your hosts go the internet, their accesses are logged in the /var/squid/access.log
<br>
P.S. While the whole excercise was done to cache f.i. yum and other packages during installation, I found that most of the repositories don't play nicely with the http-headers thereby causing MISSES in the cache.

<p>Last night I got a twitter message from mac stories, telling me <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/giveaway-contest-win-5-copies-of-flux/">about their contest win a Flux license</a>. Normally I don't go for this kind of stuff. But something must have triggered me. Probably the fact that I have to create a website for our <a href="http://www.buitengewooon.be">bed and breakfast</a> with some non trial css involved.</p>
<p>
I downloaded <a href="http://www.theescapers.com/flux2/index.html">flux2/beta</a> from <a href="http://theescapers.com/">http://theescapers.com/</a> and I must say, nice toolset. It has a very developed plugin set, including roundcorners, jquery, mootools and can also be used for rails developments.
</p>
<p>
So to summarize: it looks every bit promising, so why not enter the competition. Here's how I see it:<br>

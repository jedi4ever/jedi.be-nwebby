### Problem
Sometimes the evident doesn't work anymore

<pre><code>$ gem instal ultraviolet

ERROR:  http://gems.rubyforge.org/ does not appear to be a repository
ERROR:  could not find gem ultraviolet locally or in a repository
</code></pre>

### Solution
Most of the time, it's the http server being down. Rsync often keeps on working.
So we can get the gems via rsync

<pre><code>$ rsync -av rsync://master.mirror.rubyforge.org/gems/<yourgem>* mylocaldir 
$ gem install -l <file.gem>
</code></pre>

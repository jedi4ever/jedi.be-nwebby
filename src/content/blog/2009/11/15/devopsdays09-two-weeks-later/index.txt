I had real fun organizing <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/">Devopsdays 09</a>. There was such a warm family feeling, it felt great hanging out with all these like minded people. Impressive to see so many brilliant minds together in one room. Have a look at the [presentations](http://www.devopsdays.org/ghent09/programme) and see the [buzz](http://www.devopsdays.org/ghent09/buzz) it created.
 
I'll be honest, for the past few years, when I went to some of the Agile conferences, it felt like preaching in the dessert. I was kinda giving up, maybe the idea was too crazy: developers and ops working together.

But now, oh boy, the fire is really spreading: 

- there are discussions starting both on the [puppet](http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users) and [agile administration](http://groups.google.com/group/agile-system-administration) mailinglists.
- on the [lrug conference](http://lrug.org/) some devopsdays attendees made a fantastic extension to it.
- and in their tweets, I see people having a look at how agile can help them

That's all really valuable, because there still is a lot to discuss. As [Bart](http://bart.vanbrabant.eu/2009/10/31/devops/) and [Dan](http://www.agileweboperations.com/devopsdays-2009/) both mentioned in their reports, we are still in a very alpha state:

- we need to build up more detailed descriptions of our ideas
- more examples so that enterprises can also pick up
- try to translate all this in windows oriented environments
- actively try to involve more developers into this line of thinking

The conference really inspired me to continue to promote these ideas and some actions are bound happen:
 
- there is a devopsdays USA coming up (probably around end of april 2010)
- devops.info is coming , a site where we gather all related material
- put up a wiki on this. We already got a [Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) community license with the support of [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com)!
- start on a book on it (anyone want to help?)
- startup a kind of alliance, to support new initiatives 

And remember it's all about putting the fun back into IT!

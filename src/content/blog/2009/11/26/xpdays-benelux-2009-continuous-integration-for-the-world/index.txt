Here are the slides of my presentations at [Xpdays Benelux 2009](http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2009/Program.html). The presentation is on how we could bring sysadmins and developers closer together by using continuous integration in both worlds.

I would very much like to thank [Gildas Le Nadan](http://blog.endemics.info/) for helping with the first version of it at [Xpdays France 2009](http://xpday.fr). Also I want to thank the organizers for this great conference! And for giving me the chance to speak about this rather niche subject.

Thanks to the [devopsdays conference](http://www.devopsdays.org), the idea of **devops** seems to live on. While talking with other people about it, I realize that it is difficult to frame it within the current IT landscape. At lot of the ideas are coming from different kinds of emerging **technologies** (T) and **process management** (P) approaches. 

For me the two most important observations are:

- there is a **increase in feedback loops** between business, all parts of the delivery process and operations
- thanks to this feedback loops we **increase the quality** and speed up the flow

So where can you look for devops ideas ? As you can see on the map , these interactions are all over the place. 

- (A) **Business focusing on both functional and non-functional requirements**: business are becoming aware that f.i. downtime and data loss can really drive their customers to the competition
- (B) **New software architectures driven by the *-ities**: new topics as NO-SQL databases, queueing systems are increasingly used in software architecture to handle scability, caching systems like memcached in combination with programming languages
- (C) **Testing and monitoring growing towards each other**: reuse of test logic into the monitoring system (f.i. cucumber-nagios), using monitoring probes in test environment to validate applications under scenario's
- (D) **Operations teams organizing themselves to cope with changes from business**: ideas like agile operations and lean operations
- (E) **Closer interaction between development and system engineering during the projects**: agile project methods or others that form a multifunctional team instead of different silo's
- (F) **Project Learning from operations**: architects now actively inside projects and getting feedback of operations on what works or not, for better redesign
- (G) **Operations as a first listener to customer problems**: Operations can also make the difference similar to sales in treating the customer right and listening in on problems and providing feedback to the business
- (H) **Business using operational metrics as feedback**: to see what customers like or how they act on decreases in performances or outage is becoming an important feedback loop to make better business decisions
- (I) **Sysadmins using development techniques**: using code repositories, continuous integration, testing tools, design patterns to handle automation and provisioning of systems
- (J) **Deployment growing towards configuration mgt**: provisioning a systems uses a configuration management for the definition and these same tools (chef, puppet) are used for operational/live changes as well 
- (K) **Operations teams developing new tools for managing systems**: as there is still a large tool gap, a lot of sysadmins are working on better tools for mass deployment, large configuration changes, monitoring
- (L) **New system architectures**: this were cloud computing and agile infrastructure comes in, better and innovative ways to automate the provisioning and deployment
- (M) **Operations team going upstream in the process instead of more passive role**: Experiments with kanban in operations to interact during the project phase and even before the project phase (sales, Service Leve Management)

You can probably find a lot more or think that some have nothing to do with devops as such. I really like to hear your thoughts on this list. The focus of this post is not by the 100% exactness or completeness. Think of it as work in process waiting for your feedback ;-)

In the beginning of this year I was lucky to be asked by [John Allspaw](http://www.kitchensoap.com/) <i>former Chief Engineer at Flickr</i> and Jesse Robins <i>CEO at Opscode</i> to write a chapter on Monitoring for the upcoming book on Web Operations. When he told me the names working on the book, I felt really excited and humble among these great names of industry. I want to thank all the people helping me review my chapter. It was a great learning experience and now I know how bad my English is as a non-native speaker.

The book will be released at the [Oreilly Velocityconf 2010](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010) and whatever money it will raise will go to [826 Valencia National Foundation](http://www.826national.org/) .

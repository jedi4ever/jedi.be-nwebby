<p>I have been following 'Puppet' from <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppetlabs</a> for several years now. I love the idea of 'Infrastructure as Code'. Some people say: <i>All the cool things happen in the US</i>. </p>
<p>But now the original developer and current CEO Luke Kanies and a lot of Puppet adepts are joining together for the next <strong>Puppetcamp in Europe, Belgium , Ghent on 27 and 28 of May 2010</strong> </p>
<p>
While handling the registrations for the event, I got an insight on the experience level of the <a href="http://puppetcamp.org/europe-2010-ghent/participants/">attendees</a>, and I must say, <i>I'm really impressed!</i>. Some people manage over a 1000 nodes in their companies and their code-fu level are extra-ordinary. I'm sure the event is going to rock as hell.

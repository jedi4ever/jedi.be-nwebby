On 25 March the UKUUG organized their '[UKUUG Spring Conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/spring2010/)'. I must say, it was a long time ago since I went up to a Unix User group conference. It was really fun to see people again so passionate about their subjects, although a lot of the talks had a rather academic edge. Being in Manchester, several of the devops crowd came down and we had a nice chat with them.

Together with Julian Simpson aka as the illustrious '[BuildDoctor](http://www.build-doctor.com)'. We presented a session on how to use the tools Hudson, Puppet and Cucumber together. Initially we intended to do more technical demos but it turned out to be a devops talk, trying to attract people to the ideas around it.

Here are the slides of the presentation. Enjoy!

### Virtualbox Savestate and restore does not restore the network
I make extensive use of Virtualbox to test my installations. When I automate the installation , I use the savestate and restore to rollback changes I do to the virtual machine. Recently the network of the virtual machine would not be accessible anymore after the restore. A network ping from both inside or outside the virtualmachine fails. Several tickets have been created for it, and the bug seems to pop up every new update or so [Fixed in 25205](http://www.virtualbox.org/changeset/25205) , [re-introduced in Ticket 5666](http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/5666), [Ticket 5654](http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/5654) . 

The first work-around I found was: 

On a linux machine restart the network stack with  a */etc/init.d/network restart* . But that is not very portable, and it's hard to automate because the network is gone. 

A more generic work-around is to temporary disable the network link: 

<% codify(:lang => "shell") do %>
$ VBoxManage controlvm <yourvmname> setlinkstate1 off
$ VBoxManage controlvm <yourvmname> setlinkstate1 on
$ sleep 2

<% end %>

### NAT: re-establish port-forwarding after savestate / restore state
Another quite annoying bug is that virtualbox sometimes looses it's NAT mappings [Ticket 25402](http://www.virtualbox.org/changeset/25402)
There is no other way then re-executing the NAT mapping.

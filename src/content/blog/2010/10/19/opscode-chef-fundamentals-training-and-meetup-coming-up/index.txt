<p>In the beginning of the year the people from <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppetlabs</a> asked me to organize a <a href="http://puppetcamp.org">PuppetCamp Europe 2010</a>, and about a week later the guys from <a href="http://opscode.com">Opscode</a> asked me for a Chef Camp. It didn't make sense to do both at the same time of course, so I decided on First Come , First served. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This time, to keep my configuration management Karma points in balance in each community it's time for Chef: not a Camp but in the form of a Fundamentals course</p> </td></tr></table>

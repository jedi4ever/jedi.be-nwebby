Belgian people are known for their diplomacy and negotiation skills. Even though we are still improving these noble arts by trying to form a federal government, I'm glad to announce you that we succeeded in bringing the major configuration management players to Belgium:</td></tr></table>

During [Fosdem 2011](http://www.fosdem.org/2011) there will be **configuration management** devroom, a major achievement! 

[The Configuration Management DevRoom at is looking for talks](http://www.puppetlabs.com/blog/call-for-papers-configuration-management-devroom-at-fosdem-2011/), anyone interested has until the 8th of January to submit. Presentations are to be formal and not longer than 30 minutes, plus 15 extra for questions (45 in total). Panels with more than one speaker are also of interest.

This means that both [Puppetlabs](http://puppetlabs.com) and [Chef Opscode](http://opscode.com) people are in the house!

So this is how I advise you to plan your trip to Belgium:

- _30 January, 1 and 2 February_: [Stephen Nelson-Smith](http://twitter/lordcope)  is organizing an Opscode Chef Fundamentals course in London, United Kingdom - venue to be confirmed. Not yet Belgium, but close enough :)
- _3 and 4 February_: [Opscode Chef Advanced training course in Ghent, Belgium](http://www.jedi.be/events/opscode-chef-advanced-2011/)
- _5 and 6 February_: [Fosdem 2011](http://fosdem.org/2011) the *free* and opensource software developers' european meeting
- _7 February_: site seeing in Belgium, trying out all the beers, chocolates and get some rest...
- _8 till 10 February_: [Puppet Training organized by Open Future](http://www.open-future.be/european-puppet-training)

No excuses, be there!

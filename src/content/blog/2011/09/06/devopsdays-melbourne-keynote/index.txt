At the first [devopsdays in Ghent 2009](http://devopsdays.org/events/2009-ghent/) we were extremely lucky to have [Lindsay Holmwood](http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/) present. 

I had to skip the first devopsdays downunder. So I was honoured to be asked by Lindsay to do a [keynote on devops in Melbourne](http://devopsdownunder.org/).

It was a great conference and I really enjoyed meeting several of my twitter-buddies in the flesh. If you have the chance, go to it next year!
All talks were recorded, you can find them on [the programme page on the website](http://devopsdownunder.org/programme/)

The talk became a kind of FAQ response about devops. There are many questions and ideas that pop-up on the internet that are often the same. With my keynote I hope to address many of them in a consistent way.

Enjoy my presentation slides:

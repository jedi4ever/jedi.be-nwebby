I make it no secret. I simply love [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com). Why? 

- I think I mainly love it for it's simplicity , only a few keystrokes and you're up and running
- the fact that sharing becomes so easy across team members (even to sales)
- and we can all reuse our favorite tools (chef/puppet/shell) and editors
- all from simple textfiles , version controlled

One of the ideas I got back from discussing it with [Lee Thompson](http://dev2ops.org/blog/2010/1/30/please-welcome-dev2opss-newest-blogger-lee-thompson.html) was thaat it would be nice to have the same repeatability for a development/desktop environment. Is every developer's laptop a special snowflake? Or can we manage it the same as a rebuildable server. I think this fits nicely with [Joshua Timberman managing his desktop with Chef](http://jtimberman.posterous.com/update-to-managing-my-workstations).

The second idea, is that it would make sense to build vagrant support in IDE's such as eclipse. This will hopefully become easier when it supports ruby plugins.

I was proud to do a presentation on vagrant at [devopsdays Mountain View 2011](http://devopsdays.org/events/2011-mountainview/) and the nice folks from LinkedIn made an incredible nice video on it.

Enjoy the presentation

In this phrase I try to tackle the phrase "Devops is not about the tools, it's about culture". In this presentation I gave at [gotocon](http://gotocon.com) I try to explain the importance of tools within devops:

I believe working with tools can change your behavior which eventually leads to a change in culture. The tool itself is no guarantee, lots depends on the person, the context. But culture alone will not cut it. In that way I think the importance of tools is underrated.

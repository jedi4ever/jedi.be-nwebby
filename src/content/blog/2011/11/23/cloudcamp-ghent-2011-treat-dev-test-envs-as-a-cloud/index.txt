Over the years I've moved from Production to Test to Development and back to Production. 

This presentation is a summary of my learnings along the way: 

- After running larger production environments I wondered how it would be different in the cloud
- What would be extra if you already have configmt, continouous delivery etc..
- I learned that selfservicing and API's can make a huge difference
- and I plea for more IT companies to apply these principles in their internal IT.
- not only for machine provisioning , but also for logging, monitoring, etc ..

Here's my presentation from [cloudcamp Ghent 2011](http://www.cloudcamp.org/ghent/2011-11-21) that was brilliantly organized by [Frederik Van Hecke](http://blog.cluttr.be/)

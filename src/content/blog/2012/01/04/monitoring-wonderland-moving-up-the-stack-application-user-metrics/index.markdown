While all the previously described metric systems have easy protocols, they tend to stay in Sysadmin/Operations land. But you should not stop there.
There is a lot more to track than CPU,Memory and Disk metrics. This blogpost is about metrics up the stack: at the Application Middleware, Application and the User Usage.

### To the cloud
#### Application Metrics
Maybe grumpy sysadmins have scared the developers and business to the cloud. It seems that the space of Application metrics, whether it's Ruby, Java , PHP is being ruled today by [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/)
In a blogpost New Relic describes serving about [20 Billion Metrics A day](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/7/18/new-relic-architecture-collecting-20-billion-metrics-a-day.html).

- The New Relic - Ruby gem <https://github.com/newrelic/rpm> is the official one

It allows for easy instrumentation of ruby apps, but they also have support for [PHP, Java, .NET, and Python](http://newrelic.com/why-new-relic/works-everywhere)

Part of their secret of success is the easy at how developers can get metrics from their application by adding a few files, and a token. 

Several other cloud monitoring vendors are stepping into arena, and I really hope to see them grow the space and give some competition:

- Scout : <https://scoutapp.com> comes from the traditional server mangement and is slowly moving to the application metrics
- Librato : <https://metrics.librato.com> can lerage existing agents such as StatsD, CollectD, and JMX 
- Boundary : <https://boundary.com> has a focus on realtime view of metrics
- DataDog: <http://www.datadoghq.com> goes for a complete overview of all your metrics

Some other complementary services, popular amongst developers are: 

- Get Exceptional: <http://www.getexceptional.com/> It tracks errors in web apps. It reports them in real-time and gathers the info you need to fix them fast.
- Airbrake: <http://airbrake.io> it collects errors generated by other applications, and aggregates the results for review.
- Alert grid: <http://alert-grid.com/> a Workflow system , ala yahoo pipes for notifications
- Proby: <http://probyapp.com/> Cron monitoring made simple
- Pingdom: <http://www.pingdom.com/> Uptime and performance monitoring made easy
- Pagerduty: <http://www.pagerduty.com/> Alerting that can be easily hooked into your existing monitoring solution

Check this blogpost on [Monitoring Reporting Signal, Pingdom, Proby, Graphite, Monit , Pagerduty, Airbrake](http://blog.signalhq.com/2011/12/09/monitoring-reporting-signal/) to see how they make a powerful team.

#### User tracking Metrics - Cloud
##### Clicks, Page view etc ...
Besides the application metrics, there is one other major player in web metrics. [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)

I found several tools to get data out of it using the [Google Analytics API](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/)

- Garb - A ruby wrapper for the google analytics API: <https://github.com/vigetlabs/garb>
- Gem for talking to Google Analytics API: <https://github.com/rumble/gattica>
- Google Analytics with Ruby and Garb: <http://www.viget.com/extend/google-analytics-api-with-ruby-and-garb-making-it-even-easier>
- More recent: Google Analytics Data Export API with Ruby + Gattica: <http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/google-analytics-data-export-api-with-rubygattica/2011/02/22>
- Gattica - More recent fork by Deviantech, with goals and segment support: <https://github.com/chrisle/gattica>

With google Analytics there is always a delay on getting your data; 

If you want to have realtime statistics/metrics checkout Gaug.es <http://get.gaug.es> :

- Use the Gauges gem: <https://github.com/orderedlistinc/gauges-gem> to import/export data

###### A/B Testing
Haven't really gotten into this, but well worth exploring getting metrics out of A/B testing

- Optimizely: <http://www.optimizely.com>
- Visual Website Optimizer: <http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com>
- Google Web Optimizer: <http://www.google.com/websizeoptimizer>

###### Page render time
Another important to track is the page render time. This is well explained in the [Real User Monitoring- Chapter 10 -  Complete Web Monitoring - O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com/web-development/excerpts/9780596155131/chapter-10.html)

Again Newrelic provides RUM : Real User Monitoring. See [How we provide real user monitoring: A quick technical review](http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/05/17/how-rum-works/) for more technical info

### Who needs a cloud anyway
Putting your metrics into the cloud can be very convenient , but it has downsides:

- most tools don't have way to redirect/replicate the metrics they collect internally
- that makes it hard to correlate with your internal metrics
- it's easy to get metrics in, but hard to get the full/raw data out again
- it depends on the internet , duh, and sometimes this fails :)
- or privacy or the volume of metrics just isn't possible to put it out in the cloud

#### Application Metrics - Non - Cloud
In his epic [Metrics Anywhere](http://codahale.com/codeconf-2011-04-09-metrics-metrics-everywhere.pdf), Codahale explains the importance of instrumenting your code with metrics.
This looks very promising as this is really driven from the developers world:

**Java**

- CodaHale Metrics: <https://github.com/codahale/metrics> allows Capturing JVM- and application-level metrics.
- Simon Java  - Simple Monitoring API: <http://code.google.com/p/javasimon>
- Stajistics a free monitoring and runtime performance statistics collection API for Java <https://code.google.com/p/stajistics>
- Parfait- Java performance framework: <https://code.google.com/p/parfait>

Or you can always use JMX to monitor/metrics from your application

- JMX - JR Ruby Jmx: <https://github.com/enebo/jmxjr> allows you to access the Mbeans as a ruby class
- An example using JMX and Jruby: <https://github.com/nicksieger/advent-jruby>

And with JMX-trans <http://code.google.com/p/jmxtrans> you can feed jmx information into Graphite, Ganglia, Cacti/Rrdtool, 

**Other**

- Ruby Metrics Equivalent by JohnEwart: <https://github.com/johnewart/ruby-metrics>
- Ruby - FnordMetric <https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric> is a highly configurable (and pretty fast) realtime app/event tracking thing based on ruby eventmachine and redis. You define your own plotting and counting functions as ruby blocks!
- Pinba - Monitoring Php Processing using Timers - <http://pinba.org/wiki/Main_Page>
- A good overview post about [collecting application metrics in java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3830574/collecting-application-metrics-in-java-optionally-net)
- An opensource New Relic clone : <https://github.com/devmen/FreeRelic>

**Esty style: StatsD**

To collect various metrics, Etsy has created StatD <https://github.com/etsy/statsd> a network daemon for aggregating statistics (counters and timers), rolling them up, then sending them to graphite.

There have been written clients in many languages php, java, ruby etc..

Other companies have been raving about the [benefits of StatsD](http://adminsgoodies.com/the-benefits-of-using-statsd/) and for example Shopify has [completely integrated it in their environment](http://www.shopify.com/technology/3709232-statsd-at-shopify)

- Ruby gems for registering metrics with Statsd - <http://rubydoc.info/gems/fozzie>
- A Statsd Server in Ruby - <https://github.com/fetep/ruby-statsd>
- A Statsd Client in Ruby - <https://github.com/github/statsd-ruby>
- Another Statsd Client in Ruby - <http://github.com/bvandenbos/statsd-client>
- A Statsd client that isn't a direct port- <https://github.com/reinh/statsd>
- Statd instrumentation via Metaprogramming Methods in Ruby - <https://github.com/shopify/statsd-instrument>

It's incredible to see the power and simplicity of this; I've created a simple Proof of Concept to extract the statsd metrics on ZeroMQ in this [experimental fork](https://github.com/jedi4ever/statsd)

MetricsD <https://github.com/tritonrc/metricsd> tries to marry both Etsy's statsD and the Coda Hale / Yammer's Metrics Library for the JVM and puts the data into Graphite.  It should be drop-in compatible with Etsy's statsd, although with added explicit support for meters (with the m type) and gauges (with the g type) and introduce the h (histogram) type as an alias for timers (ms).


#### User tracking - Non Cloud
##### Clicks, Page view etc ...
Here are some [Open Source Web Analytics](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-open-source-web-analytics-tools-google-analytics-fan/) libraries. These are merely links, haven't investigated it enough, work in progress

- [Open Web Analytics](http://www.openwebanalytics.com/)
- [Grape Web Statistics](http://www.quate.net/grape)
- [Ruwa - Ruby on Rails Web Analytics](https://github.com/rosario/ruwa)
- [Riopro/piwik - ruby gem ](https://github.com/riopro/piwik)
- [JKraemer piwik-tracker](https://github.com/jkraemer/piwik-tracker)
- [Autometal - Piwik ruby gem](https://github.com/Achillefs/autometal-piwik)
- [Awstats Reader - in Python](https://github.com/jkugler/awstats_reader)

Another tool worth mentioning for tracking endusers is HummingBird - <http://hummingbirdstats.com/> . It is NodeJS based an allows for realtime web traffic visualization. To send metrics is has a very simple UDP protocol.

- [Hummingbird - UDP CLient protocol](https://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird/blob/master/client/udp_client_sample.js)
- [CaPRét: a site using HummingBird in Action](http://www.mura.org/2011/09/capret-basic-analytics/)

###### A/B Testing
At [Arrrrcamp](http://arrrrcamp.be/) I saw a [great presentation on A/B Testing](http://speakerdeck.com/u/andrew/p/b-testing-everything-with-split) by Andrew Nesbitt([@teabass](http://teabass.com). Do watch [the video](http://arrrrcamp.be/videos/2011/andrew-nesbitt---ab-testing-everything-with-split/) to get inspired!

He pointed out several A/B testing frameworks:

- ABingo : Rails A/B Testing - <http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo>
- Seven Minute Abs: Rails A/B Testing - <https://github.com/paulmars/seven_minute_abs>
- Vanity: Experiment Driven Development - <http://vanity.labnotes.org/>

And presented his own A/B Testing framework: Split - <http://github.com/andrew/split>

It would be interesting to integrate this further into traditional Monitoring/Metrics tools. View metrics per new version/enabled flags etc... In a Nutshell food for thought.

###### Page render time
For checking the page render time, I could not really found Open Source Alternatives.

There is a page by Steve Sounders about Episodes <http://stevesouders.com/episodes/paper.php>.
Or you can track your Apache logs with [Mod Log I/O](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_logio.html)

### Conclusion
It's exciting to see the cross over between both development, operations and business. Up until now only New Relic has a very well integrated suite for all metrics. Hope the internal solutions catch up.

Now that we have all that data, it's time to talk about dashboards and visualization. On to the next blogpost.

If you are using other tools, have ideas, feel free to add them in the comments.

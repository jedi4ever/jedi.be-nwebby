It's the time of year that all conferences are gearing up. Here's a list of conferences I'm speaking or wish I was attending.

- [ChefConf 12](http://chefconf.opscode.com/) - May 15-17 : the place to be if you're anything with chef these days

- [GOTOCon Copenhagen](http://gotocon.com/cph-2012/) - May 21-23 [(me speaking)](http://gotocon.com/cph-2012/speaker/Patrick+Debois) : fun conference and very well organized although a bit too static to my taste.

- [Devopsdays Tokyo](http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-tokyo/) - May 26: Tokyo was always on my list, I can't go , bummers. Botchagalupe is winning :)

- [Atlassian Summit](http://summit.atlassian.com/) - May 30,June 1 [(me speaking)](http://summit.atlassian.com/?tab=agenda---training) : really proud to be opening the devops track at my current employer. First time my employer has an explicit interest in devops. Go-go atlassian!

- [Kanban for Devops , Belgium](http://agilemanagement.net/index.php/Blog/kanban_for_devops_ghent_belgium_-_june_18-19_2012/) June 18-19: initially announced that I would be there, and I was very keen on doing so. Work got in the way, so can't make. But if you can , you should! I'm sure [@dominica](http://twitter.com/dominica) will get your WIP (that is Work in Progress :)

- [Velocity](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2012) - June 25-27 : the uber conference on anything on web and performance

- [Devopsdays MountainView](http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-mountainview/) - June 28-29 : this year at Google, looking forward to so much fun!

- [Webperfdays](http://webperfdays.org/) - June 28 : interesting unconference happening on performance. Happening at the same time as Devopsdays at Google.

- [Puppetconf](http://puppetconf.com/) - September 27-28 : and if you're into puppet, or config mgmt in general. A cool place to be , hope I can make it this year

- [Velocity Europe](http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012) - October 2-4 : since the success last year, Velocity Europe strikes again: Web Performance isn't a US only concern!

- [Devopsdays Italy](http://devopsdays.org/events/2012-italy/) - October 6-7 : Rome, sweet rome - sun and devops - the perfect mix

- [AppSec USA 2012](http://www.appsecusa.org/) - October 23-24 : not 100% sure on this one, but rumors go on a devops track in a security conference - sounds like fun to me.

Busy times .... but .... Fun times!

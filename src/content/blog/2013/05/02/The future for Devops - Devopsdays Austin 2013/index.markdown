I had a blast at [Devopsdays Austin 2013](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-austin) . Here's my keynote on the 'future of devops'.

My main point is that besides repeating the devops stories, we also need to seek diversity and make sure we keep adapting to situations.

The slides are available on slideshare - <http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/future-ofdevopsv2>

I've been tracking __infrastructure as code__ for a few years now. Over the years it has gotten closer to __real code__. 

Close but no sigar yet.... We've come a long way but when you compare it to _real languages_ it still feels in it's infancy. In this updated overview I gave at the [ABUG](http://abug5.eventbrite.com/), I went through:

- the basic concepts of infrastructure as code
- the differences/concepts in the languages (chef, puppet, ...)
- the editors , syntax checkers, highlighting
- integration with git version control
- integration with CI systems
- the different forms of testing (syntax, compile, unit, smoke testing)
- using vagrant, veewee and the tools in that eco-system
- debugging , profiling your code

This talk is probably the **most comprehensive tool list** that I've seen/made about the subject. But feel free to post and add your findings in the comments!

Note: that at the end of the presentation there are many extra links still to be sorted or slight outdated tools.


I've given previous versions of this talk at Devoxx 2012 and Jax2012. Enjoy the Jax2012 video here:

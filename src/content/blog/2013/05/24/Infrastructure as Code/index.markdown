I've been tracking __infrastructure as code__ for a few years now. Over the years it has gotten closer to __real code__. 

Close but no sigar yet.... We've come a long way but when you compare it to _real languages_ it still feels in it's infancy. In this updated overview I gave at the [ABUG](http://abug5.eventbrite.com/), I went through:

- the basic concepts of infrastructure as code
- the differences/concepts in the languages (chef, puppet, ...)
- the editors , syntax checkers, highlighting
- integration with git version control
- integration with CI systems
- the different forms of testing (syntax, compile, unit, smoke testing)
- using vagrant, veewee and the tools in that eco-system
- debugging , profiling your code

This talk is probably the **most comprehensive tool list** that I've seen/made about the subject. But feel free to post and add your findings in the comments!

Note: that at the end of the presentation there are many extra links still to be sorted or slight outdated tools.

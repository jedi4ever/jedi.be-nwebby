I've joined [Small Town Heroes](http://smalltownheroes.be) a while ago. 

- The apps that we build usually are related to TV-shows
- There is often no room for slow releases as the announcement is done on TV as part of a (live) show
- The app sometimes only needs to work during the episode , this means that the ROI of the app is calculated on that 1 hour
- The result is that we are constantly looking for ways to build & fix things faster

The slidedeck below provides an overview of what I collected over 2 years of research.

The Oreilly folks have been so kind to share the video of my talk:

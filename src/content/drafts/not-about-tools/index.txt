* People-to-activities: The traditional area where we focus on work models, process, projects, productivity, information sharing, etc.
* People-to-collectives: An area often touched on by knowledge management efforts realted to teaming and communities
* People-to-networks: A key aspect of E2.0 (that we still only barely understand), related to social identities, social roles, social networks, and the underlying participation structures that connect peope inside and outside of the enterprise
* People-to-organization: An area often disconnected from collaboration related to how people learn and develop their own talent - and how the enterprise can best leverage its social and human capital

> On the other hand, we’re probably all aware of situations where the simplest of tools served an organization well in dealing with a particularly difficult situation. This can only happen, I think, when the people confronting the situation are open and honest about what they’re facing and how it’s affecting the processes and people who are tasked with dealing with it.

> Nevertheless, the pain associated with change is usually ameliorated by the newfound capabilities the change brings

> Tools are, by themselves, absolutely useless unless they’re used to get things done in the manner for which they were designed. Even better, if you can figure out how to use them creatively they can be even more powerful.

You need better gear. You can’t squash that programming bug? It’s because [insert programming language of choice here] sucks. Surely the problem isn’t you.

- Novices typically don’t plan, monitor, and reflect on their learning
- Expert learners use ‘multiple representations’
- Novices typically don’t generate a number of potential solution strategies
- Novices engage in ‘knowledge telling’ rather than ‘knowledge transformation
- Expert learners make multiple passes at knowledge
- Experts view ‘mistakes’ as opportunities to learn
- Experts are able to transfer their learning to other domains
- Experts realize that the ‘social context’ is important to learning

O

> Can we see evidence of deep understanding or does it occur only in the inner world of the learner?
How can we see if someone has a deep understanding?

- Are students make sense of what they are learning by creating meaning and making ideas their own?
- Are students connecting ideas together and connecting with previous experiences?
- Are students personally involved and engaged in constructing new knowledge (may include intellectual, emotional, social or spiritual domains)
- Is there evidence of transformation?  Does the student take action or change their beliefs based upon what they are learning? How do we know if this has occurred?
- Are students involved in making a plan to acquire the kinds of knowledge they need in order to go deeper in their learning?

In the book  A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change by Douglas Thomas, John Seely Brown, they talk about this new culture as creating learning environments, not systems as we currently see in our schools. Systems emphasize control from a small number of managers, environments rely much more on the collective

Not only responding to change but also steadily adding value
Not only individuals and interactions but also a community of professionals
Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships


Code retreats: Retreats started worldwide. This is where developers get together on a Saturday for a full day of practice. They work on Conway’s game of life using a technique known as “TDD as if you meant it” which focuses on TDD being all about evolutionary design. Pair-up, work on it for 45 minutes. Then delete your code, swap pairs and do it again.
User groups: Several Software Craftsmanship User groups started.
Craftsman Swaps: A couple of companies conducted craftsman swaps. This is where 2 companies swap an employee for a week. The employees learn the practices of another company and come back and try to improve their own environment.
Craftsman Journeys: Similar to a craftsman swap, this is where you just go to a company for a week and learn what they do. So instead of going to a conference, a company will give you time off to go and work and learn what others are doing.
Craftsman spikes: These are side projects that you can use to practice craftsmanship. Companies offers employees 20% time to work on these side projects.

Transcending the Individual Human Mind—Creating Shared Understanding through Collaborative Design

> The clashing point of two subjects,two disciplines, two cultures ought to produce creative chaos

> The existence of the symmetry of ignorance requires creating spaces and places that serve as boundary objects (shared objects to talk about and to think with) where different cultures can meet and collaborate. Boundary objects serve as externalizations [Bruner 1996] that capture distinct domains of human knowledge. They have the potential to lead to an increase in socially shared cognition and practice [Resnick et al.  1991].

> group, community, or society is interested in hearing as many voices as possible for the following concerns:

> How can we encourage individuals to contribute to the good and progress of all of us?” — This is relevant in open source efforts, which rely on social capital and gift cultures (Fischer, et al., 2004b).

> In order to stimulate and increase social creativity, how can we support and exploit cultural pluralism and epistemological pluralism as an advantage rather than as a disadvantage?” — Related questions include: Is the European multi–culturalism and its local and regional identities a strength or a weakness? Are we willing to accept the validity and the multiple ways of knowing and thinking, especially by including the voices of underrepresented and underprivileged groups (e.g., people with disabilities (Carmien, et al., 2005)?

> How do we avoid the situation that voices get lost because there is too much information or their input does not get recorded?” — In other words, how do we create knowledge management environments that support the right division between pull and push technologies and that have some context awareness?

> How do we avoid illegitimate voices?” — this includes information that is pushed at people without their consent (such as spam mail) or is made available against their will (such as violation of privacy).

> How do we avoid getting stuck in group think?” — This includes seeing controversy as an asset rather than as a limitation; group think (Janis, 1972) is especially harmful if some groups believe that their way of thinking is on top, rather than on tap (Turkle and Papert, 1991).

> How do we eliminate sources of exclusion?” — This includes not only rules that specifically exclude people (such as minorities, lay persons facing experts, or people with disabilities), but ways of thinking and organizing that make them reluctant to join in.

Complex design problems require more knowledge than any single person possesses because the knowledge relevant to a problem is usually distributed among stakeholders. Bringing different and often controversial points of view together to create a shared understanding among these stakeholders can lead to new insights, new ideas, and new artifacts. New media that allow owners of problems to contribute to framing and resolving complex design problems can extend the power of the individual human mind. Based on our past work and study of other approaches, systems, and collaborative and participatory processes, this article identifies challenges

Much of this infusion is just about continuing on with current practice and sprinkling technology on top and calling it innovative. This is when it’s just a tool. When the technology transforms the way we learn, offers us new, unchartered experiences and opportunities, it’s much more than a tool but a whole new environment.

I'm think a lot about the idea of the 'Teachable Equivalent'.

In a work environment, this means training/educating learners about the way things ought to be according to ideas and polemics of schools and gurus.

As long as this is accompanied by some reflection (with actual real work, informal learning, decent management, coaching, mentoring, performance management - delete as appropriate) and a period of learning adjustment or schema refurbishment, this seems like an efficient way to go about things and achieve real learning.

You can have your cake and eat it. The problem is when people don't acknowledge (or, more likely with our current L & D generation) or even understand that the Teachable Equivalent is not real life.

Teachable Equivalents - the map not the territory.

 Marshall McLuhan famously said "We shape our tools. And then our tools shape us." McLuhan was referring to the fact that our social practices co-evolve with our use of new tools and the refinements we make to existing tools.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool>

A tool is a device that can be used to produce an item or achieve a task, but that is not consumed in the process. Informally the word is also used to describe a procedure or process with a specific purpose. Tools that are used in particular fields or activities may have different designations such as Instrument, Utensil, Implement, Machine, or Apparatus.

A two day intensive training course designed to get build engineers off to a good start. The course covers all the fundamentals required to maintain and enhance a solid continuous integration infrastructure. These include, but are not limited to, build tools like Ant and Maven, automated testing platforms like jUnit and Fitnesse, and continuous integration tools like CruiseControl and Hudson. All this is wrapped in a solid basis in the fundamental principles of CI – repeatable, independent, and portable. </td></tr></table>

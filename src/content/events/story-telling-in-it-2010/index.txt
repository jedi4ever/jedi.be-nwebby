<p>People working in the IT industry, are used to working with computers. We talk the technical language to interact with them. It's what we are trained for, do for a living, and we are very good at it.   </p>
<p>It often becomes a different kind of ball game when we have to<strong> transfer a technical message</strong> to a non or less IT savy audience. How many times did you explain things to your customer, your manager, your team, only to see that blank expression on their faces?</p>
<p>This evening session is about the use of <strong>Storytelling</strong> to overcome that problem.This aligns perfectly with the use of personas in User Interface development and User Stories/Mapping used within  Agile Development.</p>

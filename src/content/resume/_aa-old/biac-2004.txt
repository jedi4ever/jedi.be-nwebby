* With the ultimate goal to create a web-based desktop, an intranet portal was developed based upon Sun ONE Portal and Citrix.
* Via portal technology it became possible to work in the same personalized environment at work and at home, thereby extending the office environment at other locations.
* Content and Document Management was supported by using Livelink and various Weblogic Applications. 
* The environment was based upon Unix Sun Solaris 15K and HDS storage. It had to comply to the highest SLA demands. To achieve this, a complete test environment was setup with detailed and extensive testing before going to production. Additional monitoring was implemented using the Tivoli framework.

Identity Management
* To prepare for complete personalization, an identity management system was implemented based upon Sun ONE LDAP, Identity Server, Active Directory and Radius. A full synchronization of Active Directory and LDAP was implemented by IdSync and custom programming. Programming was done using Java and JNDI.

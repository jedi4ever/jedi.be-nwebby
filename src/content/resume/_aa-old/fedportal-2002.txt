* The federal government decided to do a request for proposal for their Internet Portal project. Given the experience of Siemens Business Services within large government infrastructure, they proposed to the request.
* In the solution proposed, all major parts of a corporate web solution were included: web and application servers (IPlanet), Database (Oracle).  To feed these application, a document and content management based upon Documentum was proposed.
* As the base system, Unix Sun Solaris systems were proposed. All redundancy was taken into account using clustering and loadbalancing mechanisms (Nortel).  
* Networking and security was envisioned with Checkpoint Firewall and Cisco material. Internet connectivity was achieved via redundant BGP4 internet routing.
* The proposal was not selected by Fedict but was said to have the best technical solution of all proposals.

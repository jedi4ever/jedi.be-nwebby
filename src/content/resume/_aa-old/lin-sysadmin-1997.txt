* Being spread all over Flanders, the departement LIN decided that a web based environment was appropriate for their 4000 employees.
* At all locations Sun Solaris systems were installed acting as DNS, BOOTP, POP3 and SMTP servers. Their CC-Mail systems were converted to these local POP3 mail servers.
* The NIS+ environment was integrated with the LDAP environment. Accounts and passwords were being synched between Windows, LDAP and NIS+ by a custom made Metadirectory application.
* Centrally, an internet connectivity infrastructure was installed based upon Checkpoint Firewall, Mail Relays, ISC DNS Servers, Netscape Proxy and LDAP Servers.
* Several applications were developed based upon ColdFusion and Java programming. They interacted with an informix database and ArcInfo (GIS) data stores.  
* Also during this period we had to migrate all IT infrastructure to another building. This involved several migrations due to DNS  and IP changes.

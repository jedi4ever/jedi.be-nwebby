* With an internal user population of more then 35.000 users, the organization is determined to automate the identity and access management of their IT environment. 
* For this the proper procedures and responsible persons were put in place. Based upon a new organization hierarchy a role based access control (RBAC) was implemented.
* These procedures together with the user store management was controlled by implementing the Sun Identity Manager solution: an integration between LDAP ,  Active directory, mail, HR system and even a telephony system was achieved by synchronization and applying new company policies. (f.i. password, request approval).
* All access policies were centralized using Sun ONE Access Manager and by installing Policy Agent or by directly using a JAVA API to interface with the session management of the solution. By centralizing, all access is logged to an Oracle RAC Database. 
* To protect the Identity and Access Management solution, additional firewalls were deployed , server hardening was performed and additional security measures were taken.
* Similar to the server layer, the network and application layer were designed so that a maximum availability was achieved: using Nauticus loadbalancers, Foundry redundant switches, Oracle RAC. The solution was even designed to function within a Disaster Recovery scenario using SAN technology.
* Given the high impact/visibility of the environment, substantial monitoring (7space) was put in place to guarantee the level of SLA required. 
* In order to control further changes and upgrades, a test environment was created and extensive testing was performed to minimize the impact on the existing environment.
* Integration with E-ID (National Electronic ID card) was tested in a proof of concept in order to show the technical integration of the product.

Virtual machines are more commonly used to segment applications and services. This typically induces 'Image Sprawl'. The project was to manage the wild grow of these diverging platforms.

* To manage this problem puppet was introduced as a configuration management tool. 
* As a side effect, backup licenses were not required anymore for the virtual machines that could be recreated from scratch and did not contain production data. * This totally adhered to the 'infrastructure as code' principles. 
* In addition to the OS and middleware automation, the creation of the virtual machines and routing on the Vmware ESX was automated using the java vijava API.
* Further integration with the application development cycle was done by integrating maven, nexus and Puppet J2EE war deployment.
* Integration with BigIP loadbalancing during creation of new machines

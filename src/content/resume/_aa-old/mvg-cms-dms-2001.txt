* Building upon the success of their first Internet Portal, the infrastructure was extended with a complete Content Management System (OpenMarket/Fatwire). This allowed a better workflow to publish information on the internet from within the organization.  This CMS system was further integrated with the concept of Document Management system (based upon a shared environment of Documentum) .

* The search engine system was migrated from Iplanet Compass Server to Autonomy Indexing Services. This mainly because the existing content was too large to categorize manually. Still a taxonomy based application was developed allowing the categorization of content in a demand-centered approach.

* The existing intranet and internet applications were converted to the new Application server standard (J2EE Iplanet Application Server/Tomcat). 

* Increasingly, data sources from outside the Vlaamse Gemeenschap were integrated using Webservices and Message Queuing (Iplanet Message Queuing).  Based upon this environment new applications were developed, tested and installed: Opleidingcheques, AdviesCheques (integration with Sodexho), E-Taxes integration.

* All traffic logs were centralized (Webtrends) to monitor the usage of the different websites. This allowed further enhancements of the content that the public was interested in.

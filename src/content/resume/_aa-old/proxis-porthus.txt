* Proxis is one of the major e-business bookshops in Belgium. Their website is vital to their selling as it is their only means of communication.
* The technical Internet platform was based upon Apache, Oracle Application Server and Oracle Database.
* To reduce the operational cost and achieve better service levels, the infrastructure was migrated to a collocation at Level3.  
* Due to the migration, the office location was separated from the server location. Using  a Terminal server based solution they achieved additional reduction of cost for network bandwidth .

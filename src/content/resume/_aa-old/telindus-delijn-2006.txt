* The bus company "De Lijn" made a Request For Proposal for Identity and Access Management. Together with Telindus and ACA-IT we responded to this proposal.

* The proposal was an integration for their internal offices and their public portal environment. A specific part was the integration of Network Intelligence for log consolidation and auditing. The solution was tightly coupled with the Sun Identity and Access management stack.

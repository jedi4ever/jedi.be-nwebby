In the past two year the VRT has been feeding a new media archive system with all the new content it is producing. The purpose of this project is to make this data more "searchable". Combining this new data with the old archive data, new ways of exploring are tested. F.i. faceted searches, timeline, coverflow and so on. 

Aside from the content that is handcoded, new ways of extracting metadata like face detection, audio detection are explored to feed even more information into the system

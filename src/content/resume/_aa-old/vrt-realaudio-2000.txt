* On popular demand, the VRT decided to make their radio broadcasting available via on the internet. It allready had a windows/realaudio solution to do this. But this system was not flexible and stable enough: start and stop of broadcastings are sent on an RS232 serial line. The idea was to use this signal to detect the start and stops of broadcasts.
* A web based interface was build using Apache/PHP to schedule these recordings. The new platform was Linux Based. The low level serial interface integration was done using C optimized routines.
* Not only on demand scheduling of recordings was possible but also the live audio streaming of RVI (Radio Vlaanderen Internationaal) was converted to a linux based solution.
